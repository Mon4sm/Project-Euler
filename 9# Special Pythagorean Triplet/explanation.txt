First we re-define (a^2)+(b^2) = (c^2) into a less-variable form. We get:

  a = (m^2) - (n^2)
  b = 2mn
  c = (m^2) + (n^2)

Then we put a,b,c into the given formula a+b+c = 1000 using the new variables. we get:

  2(m^2 + mn) = 1000
  Simplified into:
    m^2 + mn = 500

We know that m and n does not exceed 500. Now we iterate every possibility from 1-500
